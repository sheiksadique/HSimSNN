-- | Connections encapsulates information about source and destination neurons
-- and corresponding synaptic information
--
-- * The connections are essentially a matrix from source to destination neurons.
--
-- * The index of the top level list of syninfo corresponds to the index of source neurons - (0,N). Therefore, it is expected to have the same length as pop.
--
-- * The first int in the tuple is the index of destination neurons - (0..N).
--
-- * The length of each sublist can be more than N to support multiple synapses per neuron.
