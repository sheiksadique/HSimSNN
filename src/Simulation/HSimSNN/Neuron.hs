-- | Neuron module encapsulates behavior of a 'Neuron'
--
-- Some considerations for event driven simulation of SNN
--
-- * Given current 'state' of 'Neuron', it should be possible to predict the time at
-- which it will generate a spike (if any)
--
-- * For a synapse model with dynamics it is possible that the neuron fires in the
-- future, so such synapses should be part of the Neuron data type.
